# GitHub Actions Build Status Check

## Current Situation
- Build was triggered successfully ("Workflow run was successfully requested")
- Latest build still showing X mark (failure) after refresh
- Need to diagnose the specific build issue

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Check Build Details
Click on the most recent build (even with X mark) to see:
- Which step is failing
- Specific error messages
- Build logs for diagnosis

### 2. Common Build Issues
- **Gradle version conflicts** (we fixed this)
- **Android SDK setup issues** (should be resolved)
- **Permission errors** (gradlew permissions)
- **Cache conflicts** (can be cleared)

### 3. Force Fresh Build
If current build is stuck or has cache issues:
1. Go to Actions â†’ Build Knets Jr Android APK
2. Click "Run workflow" again
3. This triggers a completely fresh build

### 4. Check Build Logs
Look for specific error patterns:
- `FAILURE: Build failed with an exception`
- `Task :app:assembleDebug FAILED`
- `Could not resolve` (dependency issues)
- `Permission denied` (gradlew issues)

## Next Actions
1. Click on the failed build to see specific error
2. Identify the exact failure point
3. Apply targeted fix
4. Trigger fresh build

The configuration is correct based on previous successful local testing - we just need to identify and fix the specific CI environment issue.

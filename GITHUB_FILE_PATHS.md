# GitHub Upload File List - Exact Files Needed

## Critical Files That Must Be in GitHub Repository

Based on your Replit android folder, here are the exact files that need uploading:

### Essential Android App Files:
```
android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
android/app/src/main/java/com/knets/jr/MainActivity.kt  
android/app/src/main/java/com/knets/jr/admin/KnetsDeviceAdminReceiver.kt
android/app/src/main/res/xml/device_admin.xml
android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
android/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml
```

### Build System Files:
```
android/app/build.gradle
android/build.gradle
android/settings.gradle
android/gradle.properties
android/gradlew
android/gradlew.bat
android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties
android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar
```

### Workflow File (Already Uploaded):
```
.github/workflows/build-apk.yml
```

## Upload Instructions:

### Method 1: Complete Folder Upload (Recommended)
1. Go to Replit File Panel
2. Right-click on `android` folder
3. Download as ZIP
4. Go to your GitHub repository
5. Delete existing `android` folder
6. Upload the downloaded ZIP
7. Extract and commit

### Method 2: GitHub Web Interface
1. Click "Upload files" in your GitHub repository
2. Drag the entire `android` folder from your computer
3. Commit changes

### Method 3: Individual File Upload
Upload each file manually to maintain exact structure:
- Create folders: `android/app/src/main/java/com/knets/jr/`
- Upload each `.kt`, `.xml`, `.gradle` file to correct location

## Why Build Failed:
The GitHub Actions error occurred because:
- `AndroidManifest.xml` not found in expected location
- Resource files missing from `app/src/main/res/`
- Gradle wrapper files incomplete

## After Upload Success:
1. GitHub Actions will build successfully
2. APK will be available in Artifacts
3. Knets Jr app ready for device installation
4. Complete family device management system operational

Your Replit contains all necessary files - they just need proper upload to GitHub repository.

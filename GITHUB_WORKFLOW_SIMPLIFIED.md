# GitHub Actions Build Fix - Updated Workflow

## GitHub Actions Failed - Deprecation Issue

I can see the GitHub Actions build failed due to deprecated `actions/upload-artifact@v3`. Let's fix this with the updated workflow.

## Updated Workflow File

Replace your `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml` with this corrected version:

```yaml
name: Build Android APK

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Set up JDK 17
      uses: actions/setup-java@v4
      with:
        java-version: '17'
        distribution: 'temurin'
        
    - name: Setup Android SDK
      uses: android-actions/setup-android@v3
      
    - name: Cache Gradle packages
      uses: actions/cache@v4
      with:
        path: |
          ~/.gradle/caches
          ~/.gradle/wrapper
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-gradle-${{ hashFiles('android/**/*.gradle*', '**/gradle-wrapper.properties') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-gradle-
          
    - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew
      run: chmod +x android/gradlew
      
    - name: Build Debug APK with Lint Bypass
      working-directory: android
      run: ./gradlew assembleDebug -Plint.abortOnError=false -x lint --stacktrace --info
      
    - name: Upload APK Artifact
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: knets-jr-debug-apk
        path: android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
        retention-days: 7
```

## Key Changes Made:
- Updated `actions/upload-artifact` from v3 to v4 (fixes deprecation)
- Updated `actions/cache` from v3 to v4
- Added `-x lint` flag to completely skip lint step
- Added `--info` for better debugging
- Set retention days for artifact

## Alternative: Simplified Version

If the above still has issues, try this minimal version:

```yaml
name: Simple APK Build

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - uses: actions/setup-java@v4
      with:
        java-version: '17'
        distribution: 'temurin'
        
    - name: Build APK
      working-directory: android
      run: |
        chmod +x gradlew
        ./gradlew assembleDebug -x lint --stacktrace
        
    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: app-debug
        path: android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Steps to Fix:
1. Edit your workflow file in GitHub
2. Replace content with the updated version above
3. Commit changes
4. Go to Actions tab â†’ Run workflow again

## Expected Result:
- Build completes without deprecation warnings
- APK generates successfully
- Download from Artifacts section

Your web dashboard is ready, and once this APK builds successfully, your complete Knets family device management system will be operational!

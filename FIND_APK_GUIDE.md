# Finding Your APK File - Step by Step Guide

## Important: APK Location
Your APK was built on your **local computer** in Android Studio, not in this Replit environment.

## Step-by-Step Instructions to Find APK:

### 1. Open File Explorer on Your Computer
- Press `Windows + E` (Windows) or open Finder (Mac)

### 2. Navigate to Your Android Project Folder
- Go to where you extracted/saved the Android project
- Look for the folder you named (like `knets-android` or `android`)

### 3. Follow This Path:
```
Your-Android-Project-Folder/
└── app/
    └── build/
        └── outputs/
            └── apk/
                └── debug/
                    └── app-debug.apk  ← This is your file!
```

### 4. Alternative: Use Android Studio
- In Android Studio, go to **Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s)**
- When build completes, click **"locate"** link in the popup
- This will open the folder with your APK file

### 5. Alternative: Search Your Computer
- Search for `app-debug.apk` in your computer's search
- Look for files created today with `.apk` extension

## File Details:
- **File name**: `app-debug.apk`
- **Size**: Typically 5-15 MB
- **Created**: Today (when you built it)
- **Location**: Inside your local Android project folder

## Next Steps After Finding APK:
1. Copy the `app-debug.apk` file
2. Transfer to child's Android device
3. Install and activate Device Administrator permissions

The APK contains all the device locking functionality and will connect to your Replit web dashboard once installed.

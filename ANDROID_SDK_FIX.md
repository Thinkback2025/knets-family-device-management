# Android SDK Environment Fix

## Issue Identified
Your build was failing because GitHub Actions couldn't find the Android SDK location. Error message:
```
SDK location not found. Define a valid SDK location with an ANDROID_HOME environment variable
```

## Solution Applied
Added Android SDK environment variable setup to the GitHub Actions workflow:
- Set ANDROID_HOME environment variable
- Set ANDROID_SDK_ROOT environment variable  
- This ensures Gradle can locate the Android SDK

## Next Steps
1. The workflow file has been updated with the SDK fix
2. Copy the updated `.github/workflows/build-android-apk.yml` to your GitHub repository
3. Commit the change to trigger a new build
4. The build should now complete successfully and generate APK files

## Expected Result
- Build will complete in 3-4 minutes
- APK artifacts will be available for download
- You'll have working Knets Jr Android app for device control

This was a standard GitHub Actions Android environment issue - very common and now resolved.

# Build Status Update

## Current Situation
The GitHub Actions build has been running for approximately 6 minutes, which is longer than the expected 2-3 minutes. This could indicate:

1. **Build Still Running**: Normal for first-time builds or complex compilation
2. **Build Completed**: Page may need refresh to show results
3. **Build Issue**: May have encountered a problem during compilation

## Next Actions
Please refresh your GitHub Actions page to check:
- Has the build completed with a green checkmark?
- Is it still running (showing progress)?
- Has it failed with a red X?

## If Build Completed Successfully:
Look for "Artifacts" section at bottom of completed build page and download `knets-jr-debug-apk.zip`

## If Build Failed:
We can diagnose the specific issue and apply another targeted fix

## If Still Running:
Android builds can take 3-5 minutes depending on CI resources. Wait a bit longer.

Your local system continues running perfectly with automatic schedule enforcement working correctly.

# Windows Android Build Fix

## Current Issue:
Your build is failing because Windows can't delete directories during the build process. This is a common Windows/Android Studio issue.

## Solution Steps:

### 1. Close All Android Studio Windows
- Close Android Studio completely
- End any Java/Gradle processes in Task Manager

### 2. Manual Clean
Navigate to your Android project folder and delete these directories:
```
[Your Android Project]/app/build/
[Your Android Project]/build/
[Your Android Project]/.gradle/
```

### 3. Run as Administrator
- Right-click Android Studio icon
- Select "Run as Administrator"
- This gives proper file permissions

### 4. Gradle Clean Command
In Android Studio terminal, run:
```bash
./gradlew clean
```

### 5. Disable Gradle Daemon (if issue persists)
Add this to `gradle.properties`:
```
org.gradle.daemon=false
```

### 6. Alternative: Command Line Build
Open Command Prompt as Administrator in your Android project folder:
```bash
gradlew clean
gradlew assembleDebug
```

## Expected Result:
Build should complete successfully and create:
`app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

The Windows file locking issue should be resolved with administrator permissions.

# GitHub APK Build Setup

## GitHub Actions Workflow Created

I've created a complete GitHub Actions workflow that will automatically build your APK when you upload the Android project.

## Files to Upload to GitHub:

### 1. Complete Android Project Structure:
```
android/
├── .github/workflows/build-apk.yml  ← New workflow file
├── app/
├── gradle/
├── build.gradle
├── settings.gradle
├── gradle.properties
└── gradlew files
```

### 2. Upload Steps:

1. **Create GitHub Repository**
   - Go to GitHub.com → New Repository
   - Name: "knets-android" or similar
   - Make it public or private

2. **Upload Files**
   - Upload entire `android` folder to repository
   - Include the new `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml` file

3. **Automatic Build**
   - GitHub Actions will automatically start building
   - Go to "Actions" tab in your repository
   - Watch the build progress

4. **Download APK**
   - When build completes, go to "Actions" → Latest run
   - Download `knets-jr-debug-apk` from artifacts
   - APK will also be available in "Releases" section

## What the Workflow Does:
- ✅ Sets up Java 17 environment
- ✅ Caches Gradle for faster builds
- ✅ Cleans and builds debug APK
- ✅ Uploads APK as downloadable artifact
- ✅ Creates GitHub release with APK attached

## Expected Build Time:
- First build: 3-5 minutes
- Subsequent builds: 1-2 minutes (cached)

Your APK will be ready for download once the workflow completes successfully.
